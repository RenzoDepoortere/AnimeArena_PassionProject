# Learning Unreal Engine
I started working on this project with the intention of learning Unreal Engine C++.
I felt like I fell behind a bit since a lot of groups during my second year Game Projects used Unreal Engine to create their game,
while we decided to use Unity. Don't get me wrong, I really like Unity and I'm glad we decided to use the engine for our game.

# 3D Arena "Fragging" Fighting Game
Due to my love for anime and the (in my opinion) lack of interesting 3D arena fighting games, I decided to make one myself.

The idea of the game is having a bunch of characters duke it out in a more FPS-based arena map.
Game's would play out rather quickly with around 8 players per match.
The gamemodes would be typical ones like (team) deathmatch, capture the flag, ...

# Combat system
The combat system would be something similar to ![Bayonetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta)'s combat system.
The player has 2 attack buttons, a light and heavy attack, and uses a combination of them to do specific combo's.
Players die relatively quickly as well to make each character feel as powerfull as they did in their own show.

Each character will also have some abilties that would complement the character's playstyle.
An important feature would be the capability to "connect" to another player's ability.
This allows players to either power-up another player's ability or to make use of it's advantages.
Imagine having Goku use his Instant-Transmission and tag along someone with him.

I'm well aware that this project would take quite some time to finish,
so I see this project more as a passion project and a learning experience than a game I want to put out on the market.
