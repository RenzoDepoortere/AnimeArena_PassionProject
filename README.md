This is where my current development journey lies.
Since I want to make the game multiplayer I decided to peek a bit at how that would be setup.
Then I saw that the Unreal documentation really recommended to start adding online functionality from the start of the project.
When I read that, I decided to drop working further on the combat and work on this instead.

This is also the first time I'm interacting with online functionality (sadly we didn't see networking in school),
so I have to learn quite a lot about it. I'm also having some difficulties with it, since it seems quite hard to specify where a certain problem lies.
But I'm determined to keep pushing through and make the game online-compatible from this moment on.
