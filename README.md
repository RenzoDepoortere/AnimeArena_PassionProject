# Learning Unreal Engine
I started working on this project with the intention of learning Unreal Engine C++.
I felt like I fell behind a bit since a lot of groups during my second year Game Projects used Unreal Engine to create their game,
while our team decided to use Unity. Don't get me wrong, I really like Unity and I'm glad we decided to use the engine for our game
since it helped out quite a lot. But I'd still want to become more adept in Unreal Engine.

# 3D Arena "Fragging" Fighting Game
Due to my love for anime, fighting games and the (in my opinion) lack of interesting 3D arena fighting games, I decided to make one myself.
I want the game to be played like a fast-paced FPS game: multiple players and relatively fast deaths.
I'd also like to have each character feel totally different, instead of them typically being the same character but with just different abilities.

The game won't be finished any time soon, so I plan to have this game more as a passion project
where I can try some Unreal Engine features out every now and then.  

# Experiences
I've learned (and am still learning) quite a lot while working on this project
and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of Unreal Engine. 
But I'm determined to discover more of its features and get quite adept in being able to use Unreal Engine.
