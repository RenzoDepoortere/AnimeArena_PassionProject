# AnimeArena

The first thing I started with was a statemachine.
I found it really odd that the engine didn't have build-in functionality for this to be honest (besides the animation statemachine than).
I did have quite a lot of issues with this one, since this was were I started with Unreal C++.
Luckily I found a tutorial online which helped quite a bit.
